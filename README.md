Light Game

# What Will It Do?
This light game is setup to be played on the Adafruit CircuitExpress Board. The game is played with a green light that is stationary, while a white light spins around the board. The goal of the game is to click the B button when the white light is on the green light. Successfuly doing so will play a happy tone and flash the green light. This will also incease the "level" of the game. Each level up will increase the difficulty (the speed) of the white light. Failing a level will decrease the level. Beating "level 4" whill result in the player winning the whole game, and getting a light pattern at the end. Button A acts as a reset button to set the "level" back to 1.
